wifi-sniper

* script not finished , so dont clone it , dont ask , don bother me with stupid issues or even questions .
* if i get any time in future i will finish it , i dropped it here just to not loose the code i have been writting , at least most part of it .


* when finished , if !!! this script will store your scithes for reaver for a specific brand of access point and will use them agaist the target to gain the psk

* right now , it detects if you have any wifi card , starts the monitor , checks for injection , scans for WPS APS , get the brand of that AP & ask you if you want
to add the attack switches for that AP brand in database to use in future in others APS with same brand .

* dont clone it because i hate to read stupid questions from people with only 1 cell in brain that installed linux just to  call them self hackers
when in reality they are less than noobs .
